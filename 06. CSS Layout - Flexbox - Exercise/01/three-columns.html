                    <h2>Three laws of robotics</h2>
                    <p>
                        Rules developed by science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who
                        sought to create an ethical system for humans and robots.

                <div class="first-rule">
                    <h3>1st Law</h3>
                    <p>
                        A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction,
                        allow a human being to come to harm
                    </p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="second-rule">
                    <h3>2nd Law</h3>
                    <p>
                        A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except
                        where such orders would conflict with the First Law
                    </p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="third-rule">
                    <h3>3th Law</h3>
                    <p>
                        A robot must protect its own existence as long as such
                        protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or
                        zeroth law, that superseded the others. It stated that “a
                        robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity
                        to come to harm.”
